# 🥖 Bread Society

Welcome to **Bread Society** — a 100% serious, not-at-all-joke cult where carbs are king and gluten is gospel.  
This site was made as a parody submission for the [Grub Challenge](https://grub.hackclub.com) by Hack Club, because I was hungry and someone said I could get $10 for junk food. I simply followed the bread crumbs.

## 🧠 What Even Is This?

This is a *landing page* for a fake cult about bread. That’s it. No backend. No frameworks. No bloat. Just vibes, HTML, and Tailwind CSS from a CDN.  
And hey, it turned out kinda good looking.

## ✨ What's On The Menu (Features)

- 🔥 **Sexy gradients** – because bread deserves drama.
- 📱 **Fully responsive** – view it on a fridge screen or your grandma’s iPhone.
- 📖 **6 unique sections** – because Hack Club said so:
  - Hero (praise be the bread)
  - Mission (why we knead this)
  - Pillars (core crust beliefs)
  - Testimonials (real fake people)
  - FAQ (Frequently Asked Loaves)
  - Footer (knead-to-know info)
- 🔤 **Fancy fonts** – Inter and Playfair Display, classy like ciabatta.
- 💡 **Zero JavaScript** – because we bake with purity.
